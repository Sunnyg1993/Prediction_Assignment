## Hi there, the .Rmd is the RMarkdown file with all the descriptions and codes, the .html is HTML knit of the .Rmd, though it's a little bit too html documented, so I converted it to pdf, the .pdf file, should show the description of the model building process and the figures in an easy-to-catch way. Thanks.
